# OPFS Photo Gallery

So... I cobbled together all the MDN examples about:
1. [Using files from web applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications) (including about [dragging/dropping files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications#selecting_files_using_drag_and_drop))
1. [Origin private file system (<abbr>OPFS</abbr>)](developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system)

to demonstrate a Photo Gallery that stores the selected files clientside.

## To Demo

1. do not use a private/incognito tab/window
1. visit the deployed code or run it yourself (if you're viewing this in the browser, there's some widget at the right of the README)
1. either drag some files into the dropzone or else click browse or whatever and choose 1 or more image files
2. see the files' preview in the browser
3. refresh the page and see the images are still previewed
4. close the tab
5. make a new tab and navigate to the demo however you did above
6. observe the same photos still available by preview.
7. something something profit?
